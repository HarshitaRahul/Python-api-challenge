# Weather Py
We imported citipy so that cities are randomly selected based on latitudes and longitudes
-Based on the scatter plot Latitude vs rest of the attributes. We can see that in lat vs. Temp ,as  lat range keeps on increasing temp keeps increasing and though lat is increasing we see a dip in temp.
-In Lat vs Humidity , it is directly propotional to each other whereas lat vs Cloudiness has no relation
-The correlation function seems in lat vs temp in north hemisphere seems to have negative linear relationship whereas in southern hemis it has positive linear relation,same goes with lat vs Humidity in both hemisphere with very less r- value which has very weak relationship
- Wind speed vs lat has very less r-value which means that they are not related which is independent of each other

Vacationpy
- After configuring gmap using g_key,heat map was achieved based on high humid values 
- Ideal cities were separated and the hotel was plotted within 5000 radius range and was plotted using maps api
